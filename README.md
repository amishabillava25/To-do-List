Task-2:

Build a To-Do List Web App 

In this project, I built a To-Do List Web App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I created the structure of the app with HTML, styled it with CSS to make it look clean and modern, and used JavaScript to make it interactive. I implemented features like adding new tasks, marking tasks as completed by clicking on them, and deleting tasks with a button. I also added input validation to prevent empty tasks from being added. Overall, I worked on making the app user-friendly, dynamic, and visually appealing, and I learned a lot about DOM manipulation, event handling, and front-end development while building it.
